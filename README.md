First Web Project for School

This was a project for school.  I am attending ITT Tech in the Software Development program.  
This was my very first attempt at using HTML5 and CSS3 combined with jQuery and JavaScript.

I may potentially refactor this website into an even more responsive design using Bootstrap3.  I do have multiple files and 
multiple versions of images since they resize based on device screen size/resolution. Most of the visual design was accomplished 
using mostly CSS.  The functionality of the buttons and tooltips were implemented using jQuery and JavaScript.

With the above being said, this was my first real attempt at building a responsive design without using a framework such as 
Bootstrap, Angular.js, React.js, etc...
